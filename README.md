## Problem

There are tons of online videos and new ones are being posted every second. To brands, authors, and online video providers, the question is how to make their videos stand out and engage more audiences.

## Solution

Interactive videos can create a more interesting visual storytelling. Instead of showing contents linearly to people, it's better in certain cases to invite them into the story and customize their watching experience.

The goal is to firstly impress viewers and retain their attention for a longer time, and then convey the message more efficiently.
